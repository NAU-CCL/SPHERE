# SPHERE: Spatial-temporal Predictive Hybrid Epidemiology simulator with Real-time parameter Estimation
SPHERE is a  Python toolkit under development for forecasting of epidemiological dynamics in real-time. This project  focuses on integrating practical Bayesian filtering methods and versatile forecasting tools, and implemented using  **`Jax`**. Here are some key features we would like to have. 

**Key Features**

- **Bayesian Filters:** We plan to include various Bayesian filters like Particle Filter, Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC), Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and gradient-based filters.

- **Dynamical System Simulation:**  The package will be designed to simulate different dynamical systems, accommodating a range of non-Gaussian and non-linear properties, and generating synthetic data with varying complexities to support model testing and validation.

- **Forecasting Capabilities:** We aim to integrate spatial-temporal regression analysis, trend detection methods, and deep learning frameworks such as Transformers to enhance forecasting accuracy.

## Project Status
This project is currently under active development. The features listed are part of our planned roadmap, and we are working towards implementing them in future releases.

## Applications
When complete, the package will be suitable for:

- **Research:** Providing tools for in-depth epidemiological research and analysis.
  
- **Epidemic Monitoring:** Assisting in the real-time tracking and prediction of epidemic spread.

## Getting Started

As the project is under construction, installation instructions and usage documentation will be provided in future updates.

## Documentation

We will provide comprehensive documentation with tutorials and examples once the initial release is ready. Please check back later for updates.
